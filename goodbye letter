Hello All,
I want to bid farewell to you all and inform you that I am leaving my position at []. Tomorrow is my last day at work.
I have enjoyed working for this company and I appreciate having had this wonderful opportunity to work with you all.
During these last two years you all have provided me support and through your encouragement and guidance I have been able to excel at the projects offered to me. With many of you, I have shared a unique camaraderie which I hope will continue in the years to come even though I shall not be here with the company. I now look forward to this new position that brings forth new challenges and adds more diverse experience to my career.

I do wish you and the company every success in all its future endeavors.
